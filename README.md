## Tools & Technologies

- Sports Data Analysis (IPL 2022)

This project analyzes IPL 2022 match data to understand player performance, bowling pressure, venue impact, and team-level outcomes using interactive visualizations.

The analysis begins by examining dot-ball pressure, a key indicator of bowling control, to show how sustained run restriction builds pressure and forces batting errors.

It then compares wicket-taking ability with economy rate using dual-axis visualizations, highlighting the trade-off between strike bowlers and economy-focused anchors.

Batting performance is analyzed through total runs combined with batting averages, ensuring efficiency and consistency are considered alongside volume.

Venue-wise and team-wise run concessions are also studied to reveal how conditions and team composition influence match outcomes.

Overall, the project demonstrates how raw cricket data can be transformed into a clear visual story using Tableau, enabling data-driven insights for analysts, coaches, and fans.

Image wise Description:
1. Dot Balls: This visualization shows the bowlers who delivered the highest number of dot balls in a single innings during IPL 2022. Dot balls are a key indicator of bowling pressure, as they restrict scoring and force batters into risky shots. Bowlers like Harshal Patel, Rashid Khan, and Bhuvneshwar Kumar consistently appear at the top, highlighting how sustained pressure often precedes wickets and match-turning moments.

2. Wickets vs Economy: This dual-axis chart compares wicket-taking ability with economy rate to highlight different bowling roles. Bowlers such as Wanindu Hasaranga and Yuzvendra Chahal lead in wickets, while players like Jasprit Bumrah and Rashid Khan maintain superior economy. The visualization clearly demonstrates the trade-off between strike bowling and run control, emphasizing the need for balance in bowling attacks.

3. Top Run Scorers: This chart ranks the highest run scorers of IPL 2022 while also displaying batting averages for added context. Jos Buttler dominates both in total runs and consistency, followed by KL Rahul and Quinton de Kock. Including averages prevents overvaluing volume alone and highlights efficient batters who maximize impact under pressure.

4. Runs Conceded by Venue: This visualization compares total runs conceded across major IPL venues, revealing how pitch conditions influence match outcomes. Batting-friendly grounds like Wankhede and Brabourne consistently see higher totals, while venues such as Eden Gardens concede relatively fewer runs. These insights help teams adjust bowling strategies and batting orders based on venue characteristics.

5. Runs Conceded by Team: This bar chart shows total runs conceded by each franchise across the season, reflecting overall bowling discipline and team balance. Rajasthan Royals conceded the most runs, while KKR maintained tighter control. The comparison highlights how team composition and role clarity directly impact defensive performance.

6. Interactive Dashboard: This dashboard combines batting, bowling, venue, and team-level insights into a single interactive view. Filters allow users to explore performance by player, month, or venue, transforming static statistics into a dynamic analysis tool. It enables deeper exploration of trends, comparisons, and contextual performance across IPL 2022.
