This project analyzes IPL 2022 match data to understand player performance, bowling pressure, venue impact, and team-level outcomes using interactive visualizations.

The analysis begins by examining dot-ball pressure, a key indicator of bowling control, to show how sustained run restriction builds pressure and forces batting errors.

It then compares wicket-taking ability with economy rate using dual-axis visualizations, highlighting the trade-off between strike bowlers and economy-focused anchors.

Batting performance is analyzed through total runs combined with batting averages, ensuring efficiency and consistency are considered alongside volume.

Venue-wise and team-wise run concessions are also studied to reveal how conditions and team composition influence match outcomes.

Overall, the project demonstrates how raw cricket data can be transformed into a clear visual story using Tableau, enabling data-driven insights for analysts, coaches, and fans.
